They have a rigid caste structure and live in colonies of up to 80,000 bees. The queen lays eggs, worker bees forage and take care of the hive, and drones are only there to mate. Bees use evaporation and enzymes to transform blossom nectar into honey. They use the waggle dance as a means of communication to exchange food locations. They are threatened by things like parasites, habitat loss, and insecticides. Remarkably, it takes 12 bees to make a single teaspoon of honey, and a single bee visits between 50 and 100 blooms in a single journey!">

Unlike honey bees, bumblebees live in smaller colonies (50-500 bees) and do not store large amounts of honey. Queens hibernate through winter and start new colonies each spring. Their buzz pollination technique helps release pollen from certain flowers, making them key for crops like tomatoes. Bumblebees regulate body temperature by vibrating their flight muscles, allowing them to fly in cooler weather. Sadly, habitat loss, pesticides, and climate change threaten them. Without bumblebees, many plants would struggle to reproduce! ">

Unlike honey bees, they do not form large colonies; females tunnel into wood to lay eggs, while males guard territory. They are excellent pollinators, using buzz pollination to shake pollen loose. Despite their large size, they are gentle and rarely sting. Often mistaken for bumblebees, they can be distinguished by their shiny, hairless abdomens. Though helpful to ecosystems, they sometimes damage wooden structures. Habitat destruction and pesticides threaten them, yet they remain crucial for plant reproduction.">

Unlike honey bees, they do not produce honey or live in colonies. Instead, females build nests using mud to seal individual egg chambers. Mason bees are gentle, rarely sting, and pollinate 95% of the flowers they visit—far more than honey bees! Their early spring activity makes them essential for fruit trees. However, habitat loss and pesticides threaten their numbers. Providing bee houses or natural nesting sites can help support these valuable pollinators.">

They are named for their unusual attraction to human sweat, which provides them with essential salts. Found across the world, some species are solitary, while others form small, cooperative colonies. Their small size allows them to pollinate flowers that larger bees cannot access, making them crucial for wild plants and crops. Despite their name, they are not aggressive and only sting if handled. Pesticide exposure and habitat destruction are major threats to these important but often overlooked bees.">

Unlike honey bees, they live solitary lives and do not produce honey, yet they are exceptional pollinators for crops like alfalfa and vegetables. Instead of carrying pollen on their legs, they transport it on their hairy abdomens, boosting their efficiency. Though their habit of cutting leaves may seem harmful, it does not damage plants. They are gentle, rarely sting, and are crucial for agriculture. Unfortunately, habitat loss and pesticides threaten their survival, making conservation efforts increasingly important.">

Instead, they sneak into the nests of other solitary bees, laying their eggs among the host’s offspring. Their larvae hatch first and consume the food meant for the original larvae, sometimes even eliminating their competition. Lacking pollen-carrying hairs, these bees resemble wasps in appearance. Though their parasitic nature may seem destructive, they play a role in regulating bee populations. However, as their hosts decline due to habitat destruction and pesticides, so do cuckoo bees, demonstrating the delicate balance within ecosystems.">

Unlike honey bees, they do not live in hives or produce honey, but they are key to maintaining healthy plant populations. Males can often be seen swarming around flowers in search of mates, while females work tirelessly to gather pollen for their underground nests. These bees are non-aggressive and pose no threat to humans. Sadly, habitat destruction and pesticide use are reducing their numbers, emphasizing the need to protect wildflower-rich environments where they thrive.">

They are solitary insects that dig small burrows in loose or sandy soil, creating underground nests where they lay eggs and store pollen. Despite their ground-nesting habit, they are harmless and do not damage gardens or lawns. Their fluffy bodies make them excellent at collecting and transferring pollen, improving biodiversity. Unlike aggressive stinging bees, mining bees are gentle and rarely sting. However, their populations are at risk due to urban development, pesticide use, and soil disturbances that destroy their nesting sites.">

Unlike aggressive yellowjackets, they are generally calm unless their nest is disturbed. These wasps are both pollinators and natural pest controllers, feeding on caterpillars and other insects. They play a crucial role in garden ecosystems by reducing pest populations and transferring pollen between flowers. Their long legs and slender bodies make them easy to recognize. While their sting is painful, they do not sting unless provoked. Paper wasps are beneficial, but their nests near human activity can be problematic, leading to occasional conflicts.">

Instead, they lay their eggs inside the nests of solitary bees and other wasps, where their larvae consume the host’s food supply. Their tough exoskeleton helps them survive attacks if discovered by the host. Though parasitic, they still contribute to pollination when drinking nectar. Their shimmering blue, green, or red bodies make them some of the most visually striking wasps. Unlike many wasps, they cannot sting humans. Habitat destruction threatens their populations, as they rely on a variety of other insect species to survive.">

Unlike social wasps, they do not defend their nests aggressively and rarely sting. They are excellent hunters, paralyzing spiders and sealing them inside their nests as food for their larvae. Though they do not form colonies, they are important pollinators, visiting flowers for nectar while hunting. Their slender bodies and long, thin waists set them apart from other wasps. Mud daubers are considered harmless to humans and beneficial for controlling spider populations, making them welcome guests in many environments.">
