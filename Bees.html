			<img src="images/honey-bee.jpg" alt="A picture of a bee on a flower" class="inspect-img" data-title="The Honey Bee:" data-desc="The Honey Bee (Apis species) is an important pollinator responsible for plant reproduction and world food production. They have a rigid caste structure and live in colonies of up to 80,000 bees. The queen lays eggs, worker bees forage and take care of the hive, and drones are only there to mate. Bees use evaporation and enzymes to transform blossom nectar into honey. They use the waggle dance as a means of communication to exchange food locations. They are threatened by things like parasites, habitat loss, and insecticides. Remarkably, it takes 12 bees to make a single teaspoon of honey, and a single bee visits between 50 and 100 blooms in a single journey!">

			<img src="images/Bumblebee.jpg" alt="A picture of a bumblebee on a flower" class="inspect-img" data-title="The Bumblebee:" data-desc="The bumblebee (Bombus species) is a fuzzy, social pollinator known for its vital role in ecosystems. Unlike honey bees, bumblebees live in smaller colonies (50-500 bees) and do not store large amounts of honey. Queens hibernate through winter and start new colonies each spring. Their buzz pollination technique helps release pollen from certain flowers, making them key for crops like tomatoes. Bumblebees regulate body temperature by vibrating their flight muscles, allowing them to fly in cooler weather. Sadly, habitat loss, pesticides, and climate change threaten them. Without bumblebees, many plants would struggle to reproduce! ">

			<img src="images/Carpenter-Bee.jpg" alt="A picture of a carpenter bee on a flower" class="inspect-img" data-title="The Carpenter Bee:" data-desc="The carpenter bee (Xylocopa species) is a solitary pollinator known for nesting in wood rather than hives. Unlike honey bees, they do not form large colonies; females tunnel into wood to lay eggs, while males guard territory. They are excellent pollinators, using buzz pollination to shake pollen loose. Despite their large size, they are gentle and rarely sting. Often mistaken for bumblebees, they can be distinguished by their shiny, hairless abdomens. Though helpful to ecosystems, they sometimes damage wooden structures. Habitat destruction and pesticides threaten them, yet they remain crucial for plant reproduction.">

			<img src="images/Mason-Bee.jpg" alt="A picture of a mason bee on a flower" class="inspect-img" data-title="The Mason Bee:" data-desc="The mason bee (Osmia species) is a solitary, highly efficient pollinator that nests in natural cavities like hollow stems or cracks. Unlike honey bees, they do not produce honey or live in colonies. Instead, females build nests using mud to seal individual egg chambers. Mason bees are gentle, rarely sting, and pollinate 95% of the flowers they visitâ€”far more than honey bees! Their early spring activity makes them essential for fruit trees. However, habitat loss and pesticides threaten their numbers. Providing bee houses or natural nesting sites can help support these valuable pollinators.">

			<img src="images/Leafcutter-bee.webp" alt="A picture of a leafcutter bee on a flower" class="inspect-img" data-title="The Leafcutter Bee:" data-desc="Leafcutter bees are skilled builders, cutting small, circular leaf pieces to construct their nests in hollow stems or wood crevices. Unlike honey bees, they live solitary lives and do not produce honey, yet they are exceptional pollinators for crops like alfalfa and vegetables. Instead of carrying pollen on their legs, they transport it on their hairy abdomens, boosting their efficiency. Though their habit of cutting leaves may seem harmful, it does not damage plants. They are gentle, rarely sting, and are crucial for agriculture. Unfortunately, habitat loss and pesticides threaten their survival, making conservation efforts increasingly important.">
