				<h1>Why keep bees?</h1>
				<h3>1. For Pollination,</h3>
				<p>Bees are essential pollinators that help gardens, orchards, and crops flourish. A single bee can visit thousands of flowers in a day, ensuring that fruits and vegetables develop properly. By keeping bees, you contribute to local biodiversity and stronger ecosystems.</p>
				<h3>2. For Fresh Honey,</h3>
				<p>One of the most enjoyable perks of beekeeping is harvesting your own raw, unprocessed honey that is rich in flavor, nutrients, and antioxidants. Unlike store-bought honey, which may be pasteurized or blended, home-harvested honey retains all its natural benefits.</p>
				<h3>3. For Helping the Enviroment,</h3>
				<p>With bee populations declining due to habitat loss and pesticides, keeping bees directly supports local pollinator communities. Even a few backyard hives can create safe havens for bees, helping to reverse population decline and protect pollination networks.</p>
				<h3>4. Could become a Business,</h3>
				<p>Beekeeping can go beyond just a hobby, it can also turn into small business. Selling honey, beeswax candles, or even offering pollination services can bring in extra income. Additionally, many communities support local beekeepers through farmers' markets and educational programs.</p>

			<h1>Beehives:</h1>
			<p>Choices of hives are rather simple with only a few being easily obtainable and easy to use. The three main ones i would suggest are the following: <br><br>- Langstroth Hive (stackable, common for beginners)<br><br>- Flow Hive (automatic honey dispensor, but costly)<br><br>- And Top Bar Hive (horizontal, easier inspections)</p>

			<h1>Protective Gear:</h1>
			<p>Working with bees requires proper safety equipment to prevent stings while keeping your movements confident and calm. Essential protective gear includes: <br><br>- Bee Suit or Jacket (full-body or lightweight options)<br><br>- Gloves (leather or ventilated)<br><br>- and a Veil (protects face and neck)<br><br> Choosing quality, breathable, and well-fitted gear ensures comfort and ease of labour during honey collection and hive inspections.</p>
		</div>		
		<div class="column column-33">
			<h1>Tools:</h1>
			<p>A few tools that make life working with bees that much easier are: <br><br>- A Hive Tool (for frame separation)<br><br>- Smoker (calms the bees)<br><br>- Bee Brush (gently moves bees)<br><br> Investing in high quality tools will result longer lasting and make the jobs required easier.</p>

			<h1>Setting Up Your First Hive:</h1>
			<p>Choosing the right location for your hives are essential for the longevity and quality of your future bees lives. Things to consiter will be making sure the location is not overly exposed but still sunny, sheltered from strong winds, near a good water source, and easily accessible for your own sake. If you think you have a spot in mind that will work then start there. make sure the space you choose has room for expanding because when you start you cannot stop.<br><br> When introducing new bees into your newly setup hive you must make sure you check you have a healthy queen bee. When you do transfer your bees you must be super careful since bees are rather fragile. Once your bees have been put inside the hive you must let them settle in naturaly.</p>

			<h1>So What Can You Expect In The First Year?</h1>
			<p>In the first year of setting up your new hive there might not be much happening and honey production might only start properly 4-6 months after setting up. In this time however you MUST keep watching and inspecting for possible diseases as there are many nowdays. After those 4-6 months of proper maintenance and care you might be close to getting your first bit of honey. After the first year your new hive should start to pick up production and start producing lots more honey as the bees become fully settled in. If you are curious to see how much honey more than one hive will make per year as an esitmate, take a look below where there is a calculator just for this.</p>

They act much like ticks but are way smaller. Signs of these mites are deformed wings, spotty brood pattern with dead or uncapped larve, and small reddish-brown mites visible on adult bees or larvae. To manage these pesky creatures there are a few options but removing capped drone cells can help as the mites prefer drone brood. Another option is having a screened bottom boards, this helps the bees by making the mites fall out of the hive instead of latching onto the bees. The last option is chemical & natural treatments, oxalic acid, formic acid and thymol treatments can help manage mite populations. Vorroa is the main problem at the moment as it leaves beekeepers with destroyed hives and drives prices for honey up.">

That larvae tunnels through combs, destroying wax and leaving a web-like mess. Some common signs for this are, webbing in combs, hollowed-out honeycomb and black fecal spots on frames. How to keep your hive safe from them: Keep your hive strong and healthy as they only targer weak hives, store extra frames in a freezer when not in use, and regularly inspect and clean unused comb. Although not as leathal as Varroa mites they can still hurt the lives of your bees easily.">

Their larve destroy honey store and cause fermentation, leading 'slime-out'. Common signs of these beetles are slimy, fermented honey that smells bad, clusters of bees hiding in corners of the hive and physicly seeing them in the hive. To control these nasty beetles you can use oil traps, keeping your colony strong as they are more likely to infest weak hives, and place the hive in a sunny area as the beetles prefer shade.">

				<h1>Pests &amp; Diseases:</h1>
				<p>Much like humans bees and their colonies can get sick and attacked. Some of these diseases and pests you are almost likely to see unless you take measures to prevent some of these nasty colony killers. Some of the common purps are Varroa Mites, Wax Moths, and Small Hive Beetles. inspect the images to the left for more information. Keep an eye out as it might be too late if you dont regularly check on your hives. Dont let these put you off beekeeping as its just something you will have to deal with when taking on this hobby.</p>

			<h1>Swarming:</h1>
			<p>Why do bees swarm? Swarming is a natural way for bee colonies to reproduce. When a hive becomes too crowded or lacks enough ventilation, the colony may split, and the queen will leave with half the workers to establish a new home. Signs for bees that may swarm are: Queen cells at the bottom of frames, over crowded hives, bearding bees (bees hanging outside the hive on warm days). There are a few ways to prevent swarming and keeping honey production going strong; like providing extra space, requeen regularly, split hives in spring time if the hive is growing too large. Of course there are many other ways to prevent swarming but these are some of the more common solutions.</p>

			<h1>Weather &amp; Hive Health:</h1>
			<p>Cold temperatures can be deadly for honeybees, especially if food stores run low. To prepare for colder weather or winter you should insulte the hive while keeping good ventilation, and manually feed the bees with sugar cakes. On the flip side when the weather is warmer that usual or just coming up to summer you should provide shade, increase the ventilation for cooling, and place some shallow water near the hive for cooling down the bees. If you prepare well for colder or warmer than normal weather your bees should be happy and keep them producing honey.</p>
