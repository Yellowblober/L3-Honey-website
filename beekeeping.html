				<h1>Why keep bees?</h1>
				<h3>1. For Pollination,</h3>
				<p>Bees are essential pollinators that help gardens, orchards, and crops flourish. A single bee can visit thousands of flowers in a day, ensuring that fruits and vegetables develop properly. By keeping bees, you contribute to local biodiversity and stronger ecosystems.</p>
				<h3>2. For Fresh Honey,</h3>
				<p>One of the most enjoyable perks of beekeeping is harvesting your own raw, unprocessed honey that is rich in flavor, nutrients, and antioxidants. Unlike store-bought honey, which may be pasteurized or blended, home-harvested honey retains all its natural benefits.</p>
				<h3>3. For Helping the Enviroment,</h3>
				<p>With bee populations declining due to habitat loss and pesticides, keeping bees directly supports local pollinator communities. Even a few backyard hives can create safe havens for bees, helping to reverse population decline and protect pollination networks.</p>
				<h3>4. Could become a Business,</h3>
				<p>Beekeeping can go beyond just a hobby, it can also turn into small business. Selling honey, beeswax candles, or even offering pollination services can bring in extra income. Additionally, many communities support local beekeepers through farmers' markets and educational programs.</p>

			<h1>Beehives:</h1>
			<p>Choices of hives are rather simple with only a few being easily obtainable and easy to use. The three main ones i would suggest are the following: <br><br>- Langstroth Hive (stackable, common for beginners)<br><br>- Flow Hive (automatic honey dispensor, but costly)<br><br>- And Top Bar Hive (horizontal, easier inspections)</p>

		<div class="column column-33">
			<h1>Protective Gear:</h1>
			<p>Working with bees requires proper safety equipment to prevent stings while keeping your movements confident and calm. Essential protective gear includes: <br><br>- Bee Suit or Jacket (full-body or lightweight options)<br><br>- Gloves (leather or ventilated)<br><br>- and a Veil (protects face and neck)<br><br> Choosing quality, breathable, and well-fitted gear ensures comfort and ease of labour during honey collection and hive inspections.</p>
		</div>		
		<div class="column column-33">
			<h1>Tools:</h1>
			<p>A few tools that make life working with bees that much easier are: <br><br>- A Hive Tool (for frame separation)<br><br>- Smoker (calms the bees)<br><br>- Bee Brush (gently moves bees)<br><br> Investing in high quality tools will result longer lasting and make the jobs required easier.</p>

			<h1>Setting Up Your First Hive:</h1>
			<p>Choosing the right location for your hives are essential for the longevity and quality of your future bees lives. Things to consiter will be making sure the location is not overly exposed but still sunny, sheltered from strong winds, near a good water source, and easily accessible for your own sake. If you think you have a spot in mind that will work then start there. make sure the space you choose has room for expanding because when you start you cannot stop.<br><br> When introducing new bees into your newly setup hive you must make sure you check you have a healthy queen bee. When you do transfer your bees you must be super careful since bees are rather fragile. Once your bees have been put inside the hive you must let them settle in naturaly.</p>

			<h1>So What Can You Expect In The First Year?</h1>
			<p>In the first year of setting up your new hive there might not be much happening and honey production might only start properly 4-6 months after setting up. In this time however you MUST keep watching and inspecting for possible diseases as there are many nowdays. After those 4-6 months of proper maintenance and care you might be close to getting your first bit of honey. After the first year your new hive should start to pick up production and start producing lots more honey as the bees become fully settled in. If you are curious to see how much honey more than one hive will make per year as an esitmate, take a look at the right section which holds a calculator just for this.</p>
